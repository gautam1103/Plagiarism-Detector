## Introduction

This application leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text input by the user. It utilizes a language model trained on the Brown Corpus to compute metrics like perplexity and burstiness score. Additionally, it generates plots to visualize the most common words and repeated words in the input text.

## Features

- **Perplexity Calculation**: Measures how well the language model predicts the text.
- **Burstiness Score Calculation**: Indicates how concentrated or dispersed the word frequencies are.
- **Visualization**: Displays bar charts to illustrate the most common words and repeated words in the text.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a simple and interactive user experience.

## Setup

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/text-analysis-language-models.git
   cd text-analysis-language-models

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Streamlit app:**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
<p>This command will start the Streamlit development server. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to view the application.</p>

## Usage
# Text Analysis Using Language Models

This Streamlit application allows users to analyze text using language models. It provides insights such as perplexity score, burstiness score, and visualizations of word frequencies.

## How to Use

1. **Input Text**: Paste or type the text you want to analyze into the text area provided.
2. **Analyze Text**: Click the "Analyze Text" button to start the analysis.
3. **Results**:
   - **Perplexity Score**: Indicates how well the language model predicts the input text.
   - **Burstiness Score**: Measures the concentration or dispersion of word frequencies.
   - **Conclusion**: Determines if the text is likely generated by a language model or not.
4. **Visualizations**:
   - **Most Common Words**: Shows a bar chart of the top 10 most frequently occurring words.
   - **Repeated Words**: Displays a bar chart of words that appear more than once in the text.

## Libraries Used

- **Streamlit**: For building and deploying the web application.
- **NLTK**: Provides tools for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and n-gram modeling.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly**: Used for data visualization, specifically for creating bar charts of word frequencies.
